Description: ECDSA cryptographic signature library (Python 2)
 This is an easy-to-use implementation of ECDSA cryptography (Elliptic Curve
 Digital Signature Algorithm), implemented purely in Python.  With this library,
 you can quickly create keypairs (signing key and verifying key), sign messages,
 and verify the signatures. The keys and signatures are very short, making them
 easy to handle and incorporate into other protocols.
 .
 This package contains the module for Python 2.
